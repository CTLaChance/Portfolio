# About
https://ctlachance.com

This repository hosts the source code for my personal website. It currently serves as a simple landing page with a neat visualizer written in [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/). This site was created with Svelte, SCSS, and JavaScript.

The project has a continuous deployment pipeline set up with Google Cloud. Commits to the master branch trigger the deployment of a production build of the site.

---
This project was bootstrapped with the Svelte webpack template located here: https://github.com/sveltejs/template-webpack.
