I decided to create a portfolio site as a way to practice my front-end development skills, particularly React and JS/Typescript. The project auto-builds on and is hosted with Google Cloud. Commits to the master branch trigger the deployment of a production build of the site. (This is so damn cool. :D)

This site will remain in flux as a testbed for learning new web-tech. Let me know if you want to hire me. I'm always learning new stuff.

## Building The Project Locally
In the project directory run `npm install` to install dependencies and then `npm start` to run the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
